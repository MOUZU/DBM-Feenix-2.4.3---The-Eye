#DBM Feenix 2.4.3 - The Eye
I worked on adjusting the DBM Timers for Feenix 2.4.3 Archangel Server in my time playing on there, since I've stopped doing so there will most likely be not that much of a progress from now on but feel free to keep working on my code or at least report Issues here on GitHub (if you support enough Material for me to fix things without playing myself I might do that).

#Changelist
For people who aren't into coding and doesn't want to check the Changes in Detail I'll list here the major changes made prior to this first GitHub upload:

Kaelthas:
- fixed the english locale for the gaze of Thaladred. This fix will make DBM set the Skull Icon and whisper the person and creates a Timer for everyone how long the gaze will go (doesnt work correctly, gotta rework this again)
- adjusted the time for the first gravity lapse warning from 58s to 44s (tested and works fine)

Solarian: (untested)
- increased the Agents timer in P2 from 6.5 to 10s
- lowered the next Split timer from 90 to 79.5s
- increased in P2 the timer when Solarian&Priests are coming from 22.5 to 24.5 and changed the announcement from 'spawned' to 'soon' since it cant be predicted 100% accurate
